# üöî PoliceMitra: AI-Powered Law Enforcement Assistance System

## What the App Does
PoliceMitra is an advanced web-based system designed to assist law enforcement agencies by integrating cutting-edge AI technologies. The app helps police officers streamline their workflow, detect weapons in crime scene images/videos, and retrieve relevant legal information in real-time using a powerful RAG-based chatbot.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Real-Time Weapon Detection** üß†:
  - Detect guns, knives, and other weapons in crime scene images and videos using the YOLOv8 model.
- **RAG-Based Legal Assistance Chatbot** üí¨:
  - Provides real-time retrieval of relevant legal sections (based on Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita) using a locally hosted RAG chatbot.
- **Secure Evidence Management** üîí:
  - Securely upload and manage crime scene evidence, including images, videos, and FIR documentation.
- **User-Friendly Interface** üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
  - Simple and intuitive web interface allowing police officers to easily input data, retrieve legal advice, and analyze evidence.
  
## How It Helps the Police üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Automates routine tasks like weapon detection and legal documentation, saving time for officers to focus on critical investigations.
- **Real-Time Crime Scene Analysis**: Processes evidence (images and videos) in real-time, ensuring that weapons are detected instantly, improving decision-making speed.
- **Accurate Legal Advice**: The chatbot helps officers by suggesting the correct legal sections based on the case details, ensuring alignment with the latest legal codes.
- **Privacy & Security**: The system is locally hosted, ensuring that sensitive government data remains secure and private.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art object detection model for real-time weapon identification.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Provides accurate legal information by retrieving relevant data and generating contextually appropriate responses.
- **Ollama**: Used for running large language models locally, enabling efficient chatbot functionality.
- **LangChain**: Framework that powers the chatbot by connecting the retrieval and generation processes.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used for deploying the chatbot and server environment efficiently.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the backend, AI models, and chatbot logic.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Backend environment and framework for handling requests between the user interface and AI models.
- **MySQL**: A secure, locally hosted relational database to store FIR data, evidence, and legal results.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database used for storing embeddings in the RAG model, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies that power the web interface for interacting with the system.
- **OpenCV**: Used for processing and preparing image and video data for the YOLOv8 model.

### Getting Started üöÄ
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/policemitra.git






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
